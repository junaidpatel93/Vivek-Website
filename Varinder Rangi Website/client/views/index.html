                                            Universal life insurance is a form of permanent life insurance with some flexibility. Typically it offers flexible amounts
                                            of coverage, flexible coverage periods and flexible premiums. With a universal
                                            life policy the death benefit can be increased over time based on a certain set
                                            percentage. The indexed amount can be based on Consumer Price Index (CPI) or
                                            can be a set percentage chosen by the policy holder. This policy contract offers
                                            a choice of yearly renewable term (YRT) costs or level cost of insurance (LCOI)
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The policy owner can choose a level amount equal to the face amount of the policy or the face amount plus the cash value
                                            that has accumulated under the policy. The most flexible component of a universal
                                            life policy is the alternatives available for the investment of premium contributions
                                            beyond what is used to cover the cost of insurance. This amount forms the cash
                                            value of the policy. Some universal life insurance contracts allow the owner
                                            to choose how the cash value component will be invested. The choices available
                                            can be a Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC), money market account, an index
                                            fund investment or a segregated fund investment

                                                and place it in other forms of investments. The policy owner may benefit

                                            RESP is the term associated with your child's future. You may easily get different plans. Some of you may be comfortable
                                            paying the premiums on a monthly basis. There are some people who wish to put
                                            into account whenever they have money. You can start earning interest as soon
                                            as you start saving. You can secure the education of your child in this way

                                            An RESP is a tax shelter designed to benefit post-secondary students. With an RESP, contributions (comprising the investment's
                                            principal) are, or have already been, taxed at the contributor's tax rate, while
                                            the investment growth (and CESG) is taxed on withdrawal at the recipient's tax
                                            rate. An RESP recipient is typically a post-secondary student; these individuals
                                            generally pay little or no federal income tax, owing to tuition and education
                                            tax credits. Thus, with the tax-free principal contribution available for withdrawal,
                                            CESG, and nearly-tax-free interest, the student will have a good source of income
                                            to fund his or her post-secondary education

                                        <p>A registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) is an account designed to help Canadians
                                            save for retirement. The money in an RRSP can be used to buy a whole host of
                                            investments—mutual funds, ETFs, stocks, bonds, and the like. While the investments
                                            are held in your RRSP, you won't have to pay tax on any interest, dividends,
                                            or capital gains you earn. This makes the decision to open a RRSP a wise one.
                                            Funds are usually held in an RRSP until retirement at which time the contributions
                                            may be withdrawn or transferred to other investment plans.
                                        </p>

                                            When the money is withdrawn from an RRSP, it becomes taxable income. If the income is withdrawn at retirement, the investor's
                                            tax rate is usually lower in comparison to his/her peak earning years. The maximum

                                                for his/her spouse's own RRSP plan. Since the RRSP is registered under the
                                                spouse's name, any withdrawals made from the RRSP will be treated as taxable
                                                income for the spouse and not the contributor. However, a contributing spouse
                                                may be liable for tax on the withdrawn funds

                                            used as a “safety net” for unexpected financial emergencies. However, the early

                                                <b>First Time Home Buyer Plan (HBP): </b>When purchasing or building a home
                                                for the first time, the first time Home Buyer's Plan (HBP) allows you to
                                                borrow up to $25,000 in a calendar year from your Registered Retirement Savings
                                                Plans (RRSPs). You can withdraw a single amount or make a series of withdrawals
                                                within the same calendar year. Your RRSP contributions must remain in the
                                                RRSP for at least 90 days before you can withdraw them under the Home Buyer's
                                                Plan, or they may not be deductible for any year. However, some plans, such
                                                as locked-in or group RRSPs, do not allow you to withdraw funds from them.
                                                Borrowed funds must be repaid within 15 years to the RRSP, in equal annual
                                                installments. Any missed or incomplete payments will be considered income
                                                and taxed for that year. If you take advantage of the First Time Home Buyer's
                                                Plan, it is mandated that you must buy or build the qualifying home before
                                                October 1st of the following year from the year of the withdrawal. For instance,
                                                if you withdrawal the qualifying amount from your RRSP in January of 2010,
                                                your house must be purchased or built before October 1st of 2011. Excess
                                                payments made above the minimum requirement each year will reduce the required
                                                payments in future years. Re-payments to one's RRSP will begin two years
                                                after the year of withdrawal. As with RRSP contributions, you are allowed
                                                to make repayments within the 60 days following the year end. Repaid amounts
                                                do not receive a tax deduction and they do not affect your annual RRSP contribution
                                                limit. You also have the option of repaying the funds earlier without penalty.
                                                Individuals cannot participate in the Home Buyer's Plan if they or their
                                                spouse has owned a principal residence and lived in it for five calendar
                                                years before the time of withdrawal. This Home Buyer's Plan can only be used

                                            there is always an uppermost dollar sum (e.g., $5000 on a monthly basis). Given
                                            this, if you make high revenue, group LTD plans may reinstate below 60 to 70%
                                            of your pre-disability revenues up to the age of 70 years.
                                        </p>

                                            There is variation in the policies depending on the types of disability e.g. whether the disability benefits are to be received
                                            if the insurer cannot perform the duties of his or her occupation or any job.
                                            The policy is continued after the person gets recovered from the disability.
                                            The benefits could be paid if there is a recurrence of the prior disability or
                                            subsequent disability occurs. In simple words, Disability Insurance offers you
                                            a simple, affordable way to provide an income should a disability prevent you
                                            from working

                                            have improved considerably. The majority of the medical plans have the coverage

                                            Critical Illness insurance provides a lump sum amount that is tax-free if you come across any illness which is covered by
                                            the insurance. The lump sum will be received as a cash payment and not as a reimbursement
                                            of the costs. Thus it is up to you how you want to spend the money. You can use
                                            the Critical Illness Insurance money to pay for private nursing, any medical
                                            equipment or even to pay off your mortgage.

                                            another province or country your full provincial healthcare plan won't go with
                                            you. That means, if you experience a medical emergency away from home, you'll
                                            be left to arrange for care and pay for it too.
